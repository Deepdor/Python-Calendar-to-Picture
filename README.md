# Python-Calendar-to-Picture
A short Python script that can generate a monthly calendar for the selected year/month

I've noticed that a Google search does not point out a solution to this fairly often encountered task. So here it is.

The interaction between PIL graphic elements and fonts is often confusing, so I took a different approach and used MatPlotLib. The script takes a calendar object, fills in a table and saves it as a .png file.
